A simple java class to find longest and shortest word and its length in a given sentence.

### Assumptions:

1. It will ignore duplicate words ( case sensitive )
2. It will find all longest and shorted words, if there are more than one matching the criteria.

### Prerequisites:

- Java 8
- Maven 3.6.x

### How to Execute tests:

`git clone git@github.com:varun/LongestWord.git`

`cd LongestWord`

`mvn clean compile test`

### Improvements

Please note that this is program is developed by following the agile ( iterative ) practice.

This is the first iteration to get it working with all possible test cases.

Since the test need to be finished in 30 - 60 mins I have not performed any performance testing of this solution yet.
